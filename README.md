# üìä CyberArk Business Intelligence with Amazon QuickSight üîí

Welcome to Project CABI, the CyberArk Business Intelligence with Amazon QuickSight project repository! This community-developed project leverages AWS services and advanced BI visualization to automate monitoring and analysis of CyberArk Privileged Access Management (PAM) metrics.  

Whether you're managing on-premises or cloud-based PAM environments, this project demonstrates the use of modern cloud technologies to address key business needs around compliance, access control, and security analytics.

## üìã Project Overview

Project CABI is an automated and scalable Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to provide real-time visibility into PAM data. It automates the ingestion of PAM data from CyberArk APIs and logs, normalizes and stores it in a managed AWS RDS database, and delivers customizable KPIs and reports through Amazon QuickSight dashboards. This solution was built to solve critical pain points faced by organizations managing large-scale CyberArk deployments, such as:

## üíµ Business Use Cases

- **Compliance Reporting**
   - Ensure adherence to internal security policies and external regulations (e.g., SOX, GDPR, PCI DSS) by automating password age, policy enforcement, and access audit checks.
   - Example KPI: Accounts with overdue password changes.
- **Security Incident Monitoring**
   - Identify and respond to security anomalies by monitoring events such as failed logins, unauthorized access attempts, and privileged session activity.
   - Example KPI: Time to detect and respond to critical events.
- **Operational Efficiency**
   - Improve time-to-resolution for operational issues by centralizing performance data, platform health metrics, and password rotation efficiency.
   - Example KPI: Auto-reconciliation success rates for PAM-managed platforms.
- **Capacity Planning**
   - Enable IT and Security teams to monitor user and account growth trends across platforms and regions, supporting resource allocation and future infrastructure planning.
   - Example KPI: Growth of managed accounts per platform over time.

## ü§© Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Extract CyberArk PAM data (Safes, Accounts, Platforms) via APIs or logs.
- **Data Processing**: Transform data using AWS Lambda functions.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate interactive dashboards in AWS QuickSight.
- **Secure Architecture**: Leverages AWS Secrets Manager, IAM roles, and VPC for security.
- **Automation**: Scheduled workflows and alerts for continuous monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
   
- **CyberArk PAM**: Self-Hosted and Privilege Cloud solutions.
- **CyberArk Secrets Manager**: Central Credential Provider (CCP) for secure credential handling.
- **AWS Services**: Lambda, S3, RDS (PostgreSQL), Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, EventBridge, QuickSight.
- **Languages**: PowerShell, Python, JSON.
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, AWS CLI, PostgreSQL client (psql).
